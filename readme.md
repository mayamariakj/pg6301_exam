**Intro**

This project is written in react and node.js, with the help of express for server functionality.
Babel, webpack, and jest/enzyme are used for testing.



all the cards that a user can claim are shown on the main page. The user can read information and se what the different
types of pokemons. 
you can not claim the cards before you have logged inn. 

When the user is logged they will see a little welcome message "welcome user (name)" the user can claim whatever card
they want and it will disappear from the list so the user is prevented from claiming the same card more than one time.
Navigating to the profile page the user can see its claimed cards. pressing home button will take the user directly 
back to the home page.

**The following commands are in the project**

yarn test   -  this runs the test coverage on the files.
yarn dev    - starts the client and server to do development
yarn build  - builds the project
yarn start   - this will start the server with regularly with node 

**when you're starting the application** 

yarn install

yarn test

yarn dev




Evaluation.

i didnt meet all the requirements. I found this exam very challenging but i manage at least to keep my head above water
and make a page where user can login/out, see and claim different cards of their own choice.



Missing functionality 

R4 - i didnt come that far that i could create a security-test.js 
R5 - i really had no chance reaching this point.
